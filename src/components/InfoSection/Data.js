    'Sharks play a vital role in the oceans in a way that the average fish does not. Most sharks serve as top predators at the pinnacle of the marine food pyramid, and so play a critical role in ocean ecosystems. Directly or indirectly they regulate the natural balance of these ecosystems, at all levels, and so are an integral part of them.',

  description: `Shark meat is the obvious one here; don’t buy shark fin soup or other shark meats when you’re purchasing seafood or dining out. A lot of times oils, beauty products, and health products contain shark cartilage.
    The easiest way to ensure that the products you’re purchasing do not contain shark products is to carefully read the ingredients label. Be aware that shark meat products in the supermarket are often given different names, such as flake or rock salmon. By boycotting shark products, you will help to reduce market demand, creating a shift in the market until it’s no longer profitable for fisherman and companies to kill sharks.`,
